You should see our docs: [uireact.io](https://uireact.io).

## Quick set up ‚öôÔ∏è
If you are starting a brand new project you can run these 2 scripts which will generate a fully configured project:

**Next Js**

```
npx @uireact/create-next-app@latest
```

**Remix**

```
npx @uireact/create-remix-app@latest
```

If the project already exists and you want to add this library then you will have to manually set it up.

## Manual set up üõ†Ô∏è

1. Install and set up the peer dependencies: 
```
npm i -S styled-components framer-motion
```
<small>You can define which versions of each one to use...</small>
Check your JS framework for CSS-IN-JS to learn what you need to do to set up styled-components on the framework you are using.

We have examples for setting this up in NextJS here: [NexJS with @UiReact](https://github.com/inavac182/next-js-w-uireact) and
Remix: [Remix with @UiReact](https://github.com/inavac182/remix-w-uireact).

2. Install the main packages:
```
npm i -S @uireact/foundation @uireact/view
```

3. Wrap your app inside the UiView component: 

```tsx
import { ThemeColor } from '@uireact/foundation';
import { UiView } from '@uireact/view';

const App = ({ children }) => (
  <UiView theme={YourAmazingTheme} selectedTheme={ThemeColor.dark}>
    {children}
  </UiView>
)
```
That's it... You are ready to start installing and using any component in this library ü´∂
