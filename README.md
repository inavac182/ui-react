## What? 😲

@UiReact is a React library of Themed UI components that are ready to be used to speed up react app development.

## Why? 🤓

This project started due to the need of rapid development for start ups and having a complete library with a chunk of components ready to be used with an easy configurable theme to adapt the styling for different use cases really helped us to launch multiple projects quicker while maintining a good UX.

## Where to start? ✍️

The main package of this library is the foundation package `@uireact/foundation` and the `@uireact/view`. You can learn more about this in the [getting started doc](./getting-started).
