## What? 😲

@UiReact is a React library of Themed UI components that are ready to be used to speed up react web development. The themes allows for a bunch of customization and the components are very flexible as well to cover a bunch of the most common use cases.

## Why? 🤓

This project started due to personal projects that we were working on and everytime we needed to start up a design system, create some boilerplate code and create the same components over and over. In addition to neededing to develop fast MVPs for start ups.

## Where to start? ✍️

The main package is `@uireact/foundation`. We have a [getting started doc](./getting-started) that will help you to start step by step through the config process and it also provides a few examples.
