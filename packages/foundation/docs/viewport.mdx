> The [Breakpoints](./packages-foundation-docs-breakpoints#definition) enum is used to set up one specific breakpoint where we want the UiViewport to render something.

### 2. Multiple breakpoints

<Playground>
  <UiViewport criteria='l|s'>
    <UiBox>
      Hey, I appear in Large and Small!!
    </UiBox>
  </UiViewport>
</Playground>

> Multiple breakpoints are supported as prop for the UiViewport. For the complete convination list see the Props table

## Props

<Props of={UiViewport} />


**NOTES:**

If you ask why there's not `"l|m|s"` combination in breakpoints is because well, if you need something to render in that scenario then you don't need a `UiViewport` ðŸ¤˜.
