      Hey, I appear in Large and Small!!
    </UiBox>
  </UiViewport>
</Playground>

## Props

<Props of={UiViewport} />


**NOTES:**

If you ask why there's not `"l|m|s"` combination in breakpoints is because well, if you need something to render in that scenario then you don't need a `UiViewport` ü§ò.

If you don't set any breakpoint then the children will never be rendered as there won't be any criteria to match ‚úçÔ∏è
