## Usages üõ†Ô∏è

### Specific breakpoint

<Playground>
  <UiViewport criteria={Breakpoints.XLARGE}>
    <UiBox>Hey, I'm in XLarge!</UiBox>
  </UiViewport>
  <UiViewport criteria={Breakpoints.LARGE}>
    <UiBox>Hey, I'm in Large!</UiBox>
  </UiViewport>
  <UiViewport criteria={Breakpoints.MEDIUM}>
    <UiBox>I appear in Medium!!</UiBox>
  </UiViewport>
  <UiViewport criteria={Breakpoints.SMALL}>
    <UiBox>And I'm in Small!</UiBox>
  </UiViewport>
</Playground>

The [Breakpoints](./packages-foundation-docs-breakpoints#definition) enum is used to set up one specific breakpoint where we want the UiViewport to render something.

### Multiple breakpoints

<Playground>
  <UiViewport criteria="l|s">
    <UiBox>Hey, I appear in Large and Small!!</UiBox>
  </UiViewport>
</Playground>

Multiple breakpoints are supported as prop for the UiViewport when used the string criteria. The whole set of combinations is defined in the [BreakpointsString](https://github.com/inavac182/uireact/blob/main/packages/foundation/src/responsive/viewport.tsx#L6) type.

## Props üéõÔ∏è
