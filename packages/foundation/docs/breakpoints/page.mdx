# Responsive

The @UiReact library handles responsiveness across multiple devices with the following categories:

## Breakpoins breakdown ✍️

We have these classifications for different sizes of viewports:

```
enum Breakpoints {
  SMALL,
    ▶︎ Used to render on mobile devices
  MEDIUM,
    ▶︎ Used to render on tablet devices or mobiles with big screens or mobile landscape
  LARGE,
    ▶︎ Used to render on big tablets, tablets on landscape or desktop
  XLARGE,
    ▶︎ Used to render on high resolutions desktop screens
}
```

## Breakpoint sizes

Based on data on internet for the most common viewports on each category we've decided to set up the breakpoints sizes in the following distribution:

```
const BreakpointsSizes = {
  s: {
    max: 579,
      ▶︎ No min value as anything from 0 up to 579px considered SMALL
  },
  m: {
    min: 580,
    max: 991,
  },
  l: {
    min: 992,
    max: 1440,
  },
  xl: {
    min: 1440,
      ▶︎ No max value as anything above 1440 is considered XLARGE
  },
};
```

## Usage

The `UiViewport` component uses these categories to decide when some content renders or not based on the viewport. For more information about it you can go to the [UiViewport docs](./viewport).
