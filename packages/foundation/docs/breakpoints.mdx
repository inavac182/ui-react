# Breakpoints
----------

<sup><a href="https://github.com/inavac182/ui-react/blob/main/packages/foundation/" target="_blank">v{packageJson.version}</a></sup>

> @uireact uses these 2 pieces to handle breakpoints in the UiViewport
>
> - BreakpointsSizes (Private)
> - Breakpoints (Enum used as a prop) See: [UiViewport](./packages-foundation-docs-viewport)

## Installation

The Breakpoints enum is exported as part of the package @ui-react/foundation

> npm i @uireact/foundation

## Definition

### Breakpoints

```
enum Breakpoints {
  SMALL,
  MEDIUM,
  LARGE,
}
```

### BreakpointsSizes

**IMPORTANT:** We use these values to handle each breakpoint, we don't distinguish between mobile device and desktop small viewport.

```
const BreakpointsSizes = {
  s: {
    max: 579,
  },
  m: {
    min: 580,
    max: 991,
  },
  l: {
    min: 992,
  },
};

```

Anything smaller than 580 will be categorized as *SMALL*, then from 580 to 991 will be *MEDIUM* and anything larger than 991 will be *large*
