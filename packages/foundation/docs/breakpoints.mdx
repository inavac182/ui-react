> @uireact uses these 2 pieces to handle breakpoints in the UiViewport
>
> - BreakpointsSizes (Private)
> - Breakpoints (Enum used as a prop) See: [UiViewport](./packages-foundation-docs-viewport)

## Installation

The Breakpoints enum is exported as part of the package @ui-react/foundation

> npm i @uireact/foundation

## Definition

### Breakpoints

```
enum Breakpoints {
  SMALL,
  MEDIUM,
  LARGE,
}
```

> This enum is exported in the @uireact/foundation package.

### Breakpoint sizes

```
const BreakpointsSizes = {
  s: {
    max: 579,
  },
  m: {
    min: 580,
    max: 991,
  },
  l: {
    min: 992,
  },
};

```

> This size object is a constant that we have inside our foundation package and is used to determine the users breakpoint.

Anything smaller than 580 will be categorized as _SMALL_, then from 580 to 991 will be _MEDIUM_ and anything larger than 991 will be _large_

**NOTE:** @uireact doesn't distinguish between real mobile device and desktop small breakpoint, they are both categorized as SMALL.
