# Test your custom theme

<UiLineSeparator />

This tool is useful to get a more realistic sense about how the theme is going to look like in a real scenario, we have put some elements
together that can help see the colorations.

> We recommend you open in 1 tab this page and in a separate tab the theme creation tool so you can copy and paste from that page to this page

<TestTheme />
