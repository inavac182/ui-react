# Themes

@uireact provides with 2 default themes:

## Light

<ThemeTokens theme={Themes.light}/>

## Dark

<ThemeTokens theme={Themes.dark}/>

## Structure

Each theme has to meet the structure of the [Theme](https://github.com/inavac182/uireact/blob/main/packages/foundation/src/types/themes/theme.ts) type.

The color tokens should go from lighter (token_10) to darker (token_200).
