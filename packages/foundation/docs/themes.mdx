# Theme

@uireact provides with a default theme in the foundation package which can be found here: [Default theme](https://github.com/inavac182/uireact/blob/main/packages/foundation/src/themes/default-theme.ts)

For understading the concepts and theme creation you should continue reading this doc ‚ö°Ô∏è

## Set up ‚öôÔ∏è

@uireact uses a theme file so components can be customizable for different clients / use cases. We believe that
our structure provides with a lot of customization and flexibility without getting into too much freedom which causes
UX design to be poor for the user experience.

If you use the component `UiView` then it sets automatically out of the box the theme context, so you SHOULD wrap your entire app
in a UiView, you can get more information about this component in the [UiView docs](https://uireact.io/packages-view-docs-view).

TL;DR;

```
import { @UiView } from '@uireact/view';
import { DefaultTheme, ThemeColor } from '@uireact/foundation';

export const App = () => (
  <UiView theme={DefaultTheme} selectedTheme={ThemeColor.light}>
    ... {Your App} ...
  </Uiview>
);

```

If you don't want to use the view component then you will have to manually set the ThemeContext provided from the foundation package:

```
import { ThemeContext, DefaultTheme, ThemeColor } from '@uireact/foundation';

export const App = () => (
  <ThemeContext.Provider value={{ theme: DefaultTheme, selectedTheme: ThemeColor.light }}>
    ... {Your App} ...
  </ThemeContext.Provider>
);

```

## Structure üß±

Each theme has to meet the structure of the [Theme](https://github.com/inavac182/uireact/blob/main/packages/foundation/src/types/themes/theme.ts) type.

```
export const DefaultTheme: Theme = {
  name: 'UIReactDefaultTheme',
    ‚ñ∂Ô∏é A name for the theme
  dark: { ... },
    ‚ñ∂Ô∏é A set of colors for the dark coloration
  light: { ... },
    ‚ñ∂Ô∏é A set of colors for the light coloration
  sizes: { ...},
    ‚ñ∂Ô∏é The set of sizes you want to use for fonts / headings / icons
  texts: { ... },
    ‚ñ∂Ô∏é The configuration for texts such as fonts
  spacing: { ... },
    ‚ñ∂Ô∏é Levels of spacing with its px value
};

```

## Colorations ‚ú®üåì

Our take on UX design nowadays is that you should be ready to provide with 2 colorations in your UI, dark and light, this to help
the UX of your applications when used during sunny days üåû or during night time üåô

Each coloration has to include these categories:

```
{
  backgrounds: { ... },
    ‚ñ∂Ô∏é Used for background or components that are meant to wrap content such as the view or cards.
  fonts: { ... },
    ‚ñ∂Ô∏é Used for texts, headings, labels, everything that is text related.
  primary: { ... },
    ‚ñ∂Ô∏é This is the primary color in your application and will used accross the board.
  secondary: { ... },
    ‚ñ∂Ô∏é The secondary color SHOULD contract very well with the primary, as is intended to be used to separate contents.
  tertiary: { ... },
    ‚ñ∂Ô∏é The tertiary color is like a sparkle here and there, not commonly used but meant to be very visible when is used.
  positive: { ... },
    ‚ñ∂Ô∏é Commonly used to show a reaction to an action that was successfully performed, e.g. A form submition.
  negative: { ... },
    ‚ñ∂Ô∏é Used to show a fallback action, meaning the less ideal action that we intend our users to do
  error: { ... },
    ‚ñ∂Ô∏é As its name says, this is used to show bright error messages, e.g. A form submittion that failed to be validated.
}

```

You can see the categories enum definition here: [ColorCategories](https://github.com/inavac182/uireact/blob/main/packages/foundation/src/types/enums/color-categories.ts)

### Tokens

Each coloration should include 5 levels of the main color, these are referrer to as tokens:

```
{
  token_10: '',
    ‚ñ∂Ô∏é Lighter
  token_50: '',
  token_100: '',
    ‚ñ∂Ô∏é Main color
  token_150: '',
  token_200: '',
    ‚ñ∂Ô∏é Darker
}
```

From lighter to darker, 10 ‚Üí 200. The idea is that we keep some flexibility in case we need to add additional levels to our colorations
but as of now we believe these levels should be enough to provide a good UX.

We suggest you to start with the main color and then work your way outside to both edges of the spectrum.
A good color spectrum would be one where if you render a text with level 200 on top of a background level 10 of the same category it should read just fine.

Typing for tokens is defined [here](https://github.com/inavac182/uireact/blob/main/packages/foundation/src/types/themes/internal/tokens.ts#L3)

### Light Coloration ü§ç

You can see the light coloration of the provided theme here: [Light Coloration](https://github.com/inavac182/uireact/blob/main/packages/foundation/src/themes/default-colors/light.ts)

<ThemeTokens colors={DefaultTheme.light} />

### Dark Coloration üñ§

You can see the dark coloration of the provided theme here: [Dark Theme](https://github.com/inavac182/uireact/blob/main/packages/foundation/src/themes/default-colors/dark.ts)

<ThemeTokens colors={DefaultTheme.dark} />

## Sizes üé¢

Currently we provide with the size set up for headings and normal texts.

```
{
  headings: { ... },
    ‚ñ∂Ô∏é Heading sizes
  texts: { ... }
    ‚ñ∂Ô∏é Text sizes
}
```

Typing for [Sizes](https://github.com/inavac182/uireact/blob/main/packages/foundation/src/types/themes/internal/sizes.ts#L11) definition

### Headings

The headings follows the ARIA convention and you could set up to 6 different sizes for [Headings](https://github.com/inavac182/uireact/blob/main/packages/foundation/src/types/enums/heading-levels.ts), we suggest you only differentiate
from level 1 to 3 and then 4 to 6 to share the same sizing.

```
{
  level1: '',
    ‚ñ∂Ô∏é Biggest heading
  level2: '',
  level3: '',
    ‚ñ∂Ô∏é Default heading level
  level4: '',
  level5: '',
  level6: '',
}
```

If you want to learn more about the UiHeading component follow go to this [doc](https://uireact.io/packages-text-docs-heading-docs).

### Texts

The texts uses a structure of 5 different level of sizes:

```
{
  xsmall: '',
  small: '',
  regular: '',
    ‚ñ∂Ô∏é Default text sizing
  large: '',
  xlarge: ''
}
```

You can see the texts definiton [here](https://github.com/inavac182/uireact/blob/main/packages/foundation/src/types/themes/internal/sizes.ts#L7)

## Texts üìù

Currently we only expose a property for the font family in this part but let us know if you feel more configurations are needed for texts.

```
{
  fonts: ''
}
```

Texts type definitin [here](https://github.com/inavac182/uireact/blob/main/packages/foundation/src/types/themes/internal/texts.ts#LL1C1-L1C1)

The value in the `fonts` property is passed as is to the `font-family` css property so you can set up multiple fonts as needed. Just
remember that you have to provide them to the browser if you are using any special font.

## Spacing üìê

As the spacing across the application should keep uniformity we decided to add the spacing to the theme so each client could set up
whatever spacing is more conviniant to their use case.

```
{
  one: '',
  two: '',
  three: '',
  four: '',
  five: '',
  six: '',
  seven: '',
}
```

As of now we believe having seven levels of spacing should work nicely for most use cases, if you want to learn more about the UiSpacing
component you can see it here: [UiSpacing](https://uireact.io/packages-foundation-docs-spacing).
The values in this properties are used straight as a string into the CSS for margins / paddings.

Spacing type definition [here](https://github.com/inavac182/uireact/blob/main/packages/foundation/src/types/themes/internal/spacing.ts#L3).
