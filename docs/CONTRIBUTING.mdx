## FIRST! 🧐

Before starting to work on a contribution let's create an [issue](https://github.com/inavac182/uireact/issues) in github so we can chat about what you are planning to build before you put your time into it.

## Pull Request 🔥

Make sure you fill the PR template and it passes the prechecks:

- [Build](https://github.com/inavac182/uireact/actions/workflows/build.yml)
- [Tests and Lint](https://github.com/inavac182/uireact/actions/workflows/test.js.yml)

## Publish 🚀

The version upgrades are done automatically by lerna using [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary) versioning.

Once a PR is merged the [pipeline gh action](https://github.com/inavac182/uireact/blob/main/.github/workflows/pipeline.yml) a.k.a [publish and deploy](https://github.com/inavac182/uireact/actions/workflows/pipeline.yml) is triggerd, it will build the packages and publish to npm new versions of the changed packages. It will also deploy the [uireact docs](https://uireact.io/).
