# Accessing theme values from client app

<UiLineSeparator />

### First, How are the values store?

When you use the UiView component this creates the CSS Variables required for the all packages. If you inspect your App
in the `html` element you'll see a lot of variables defined into `:root`. If you decide to enable the light theme, then
you will see the class: `light` added to the `html` element, this is how the theme changes the values of the CSS variables
based on what theme is enabled.

## Use them from the client app

So, now that you know where the values are actually stored in the CSS, using any value is as simple as just using that
CSS variable from any place in your app. For example:

```tsx
import styled from 'styled-components';

const SomeWrapper = styled.div`
  background: var(--primary-token_100);
`;

export const myComponent = () => {
  return (
    <SomeWrapper>
      <p>The content</p>
    </SomeWrapper>
  );
};
```

The variables have the following format:

```ts
--{'inverse-' || ''}-{category}-{token}
```

The `inverse` name specifies that this is the value of the other theme, e.g. if dark is enabled then this variable will have the light value.

The `category` means the ColorCategory of the theme property.

The `token` is the token level used in each color category in the theme.
