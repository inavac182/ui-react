# Accessing theme values

<UiLineSeparator />

## First, How are the theme values stored?

### CSS

The `UiView` component creates CSS Variables from the theme values, these variables are used across the library to retrieve the current value for a specific token.
If you inspect your App in the `html` element you'll see a lot of variables defined into `:root`. If you decide to enable the light theme, then
you will see the class: `light` added to the `html` element, this is how the theme changes the values of the CSS variables
based on what theme is enabled.

### React context

The `UiView` component stores the theme into the [ThemeContext](https://github.com/inavac182/uireact/blob/main/packages/view/src/ui-view.tsx#L80), this is accessible through useContext hook at any place of the application.

## Use values from client applications

### CSS

So, now that you know where the values are actually stored in the CSS, using any value is as simple as just using that
CSS variable from any place in your app. For example:

```tsx
import styled from 'styled-components';

const SomeWrapper = styled.div`
  background: var(--primary-token_100);
  font-size: var(--texts-large);
  padding: var(--spacing-four);
`;

export const myComponent = () => {
  return (
    <SomeWrapper>
      <p>The content</p>
    </SomeWrapper>
  );
};
```

The variables have the following format:

```ts
--{'inverse-' || ''}-{category}-{token}
```

The `inverse` name specifies that this is the value of the inversed theme, e.g. if dark is enabled then the inverse is the light theme and viceversa.

The `category` means the ColorCategory of the theme property.

The `token` is the token level used in each color category in the theme.

### JS (useContext)

There are a few functions exported from the foundation package that can help you get a specific token from the theme.

```ts
-getThemeColor();

// @deprecated
-getHeadingSize();

// @deprecated
-getTextSize();

// @deprecated
-getSpacingSize();
```

We've deprecated most of these helper functions as you should try to rely as much as possible on CSS to wrap the correct theme value,
however there are a few use cases where needing the theme color in JS is useful, such as setting the color of a Google Chart, the colors
are set via a config object.

So, this is an example of how you would access it:

```tsx
import { ThemeContext, getThemeColor, ColorCategories, ColorTokens } from '@uireact/foundation';

export const myComponent = () => {
  const themeContext = useContent(ThemeContext);
  const color = getThemeColor(
    themeContext.theme,
    themeContext.selectedTheme,
    ColorCategories.primary,
    ColorTokens.token_100,
    false
  );

  return <SomeComponent color={color} />;
};
```

The last attribute of `getThemeColor` is an `inverse` boolean, in case you need the inverse coloration.
