# Theming

<UiLineSeparator />
<br />

One of the main advantages of this library is that provides with a way for setting your own theme so you can provide with your own
configs for text sizes, fonts, colors, etc.

## Structure üß±

Each theme has to meet the structure of the [Theme](https://github.com/inavac182/uireact/blob/main/packages/foundation/src/types/themes/theme.ts) type.

```tsx
export const DefaultTheme: Theme = {
  name: 'UIReactDefaultTheme',
    ‚ñ∂Ô∏é A name for the theme
  dark: { ... },
    ‚ñ∂Ô∏é A set of colors for the dark coloration
  light: { ... },
    ‚ñ∂Ô∏é A set of colors for the light coloration
  sizes: { ...},
    ‚ñ∂Ô∏é The set of sizes you want to use for fonts / headings / icons
  texts: { ... },
    ‚ñ∂Ô∏é The configuration for texts such as fonts
  spacing: { ... },
    ‚ñ∂Ô∏é Levels of spacing with its px value
};

```

## Colorations ‚ú®üåì

Our take on UX design nowadays is that you should be ready to provide with 2 colorations in your UI, dark and light, this to help
the UX of your applications when used during daylight üåû or during night time üåô

In our theme structure you will see 2 props `dark` and `light`, so each of them is typed as `Color`. The [Coloration type](https://github.com/inavac182/uireact/blob/main/packages/foundation/src/types/themes/internal/coloration.ts#L4)
is generated from the enum [ColorCategories](https://github.com/inavac182/uireact/blob/main/packages/foundation/src/types/enums/color-categories.ts#L1) and this is its structure:

We recommend you use the 60 - 30 - 10 rule:

60% - Primary

30% - Secondary

10% - Tertiary

This will allow you to create a pretty UI with very easy to follow color patterns for your users.

```tsx
{
  ...,
  dark/light: {
    fonts: { ... },
      ‚ñ∂Ô∏é Used for texts, headings, labels, everything that is text related. We recommend this to be close to whites or blacks depending in the coloration.
    primary: { ... },
      ‚ñ∂Ô∏é This color should be neutral as the user would see this color in most of the application.
    secondary: { ... },
      ‚ñ∂Ô∏é This color should be soft in a way that can be used above the primary and don't jump to the user's eyes as this would be used for cards, headers, etc..
    tertiary: { ... },
      ‚ñ∂Ô∏é This color should be used for your actionable elements and should catch the user's eye.
    positive: { ... },
      ‚ñ∂Ô∏é Commonly used to show a reaction to an action that was successfully performed, e.g. A form submition.
    negative: { ... },
      ‚ñ∂Ô∏é Used to show a fallback action something like a Cancel submit. We recommend you use `cristal` buttons instead of negative.
    error: { ... },
      ‚ñ∂Ô∏é As its name says, this is used to show an error messages, e.g. A form submittion that failed to be validated.
    warning: { ... },
      ‚ñ∂Ô∏é Used to show a warning message, for instance an expiration messaging.
  },
  ...
}

```

### Tokens

Each coloration should include 5 levels of color, each level is referrer to it as token, the token 100 is the main base color:

```tsx
{
  token_10: '',
    ‚ñ∂Ô∏é Lighter
  token_50: '',
  token_100: '',
    ‚ñ∂Ô∏é Main color
  token_150: '',
  token_200: '',
    ‚ñ∂Ô∏é Darker
}
```

From lighter to darker, 10 ‚Üí 200. The idea is that we keep some flexibility in case we need to add additional levels to our colorations
but as of now we believe these levels should be enough to provide a good UX.

We suggest you to start with the main color and then work your way outside to both edges of the spectrum.
A good color spectrum would be one where if you render a text with level 200 on top of a background level 10 of the same category it should read just fine.

Typing for tokens is defined [here](https://github.com/inavac182/uireact/blob/main/packages/foundation/src/types/themes/internal/tokens.ts#L3)

### Light Coloration ü§ç

You can see the light coloration of the provided theme here: [Light Coloration](https://github.com/inavac182/uireact/blob/main/packages/foundation/src/themes/default-colors/light.ts)

<ThemeTokens colors={DefaultTheme.light} />

### Dark Coloration üñ§

You can see the dark coloration of the provided theme here: [Dark Theme](https://github.com/inavac182/uireact/blob/main/packages/foundation/src/themes/default-colors/dark.ts)

<ThemeTokens colors={DefaultTheme.dark} />

## Sizes üé¢

There are 2 properties for [sizes](https://github.com/inavac182/uireact/blob/main/packages/foundation/src/types/themes/internal/sizes.ts#L11) one for headings and another one for texts.

```tsx
{
  headings: { ... },
    ‚ñ∂Ô∏é Heading sizes
  texts: { ... }
    ‚ñ∂Ô∏é Text sizes
}
```

### Headings

The headings follows the [ARIA convention](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/heading_role#best_practices) and you could set up to 6 different sizes for
[Headings](https://github.com/inavac182/uireact/blob/main/packages/foundation/src/types/enums/heading-levels.ts), we suggest you use different sizes for
levels 1, 2 and 3, then levels 4 to 6 to use the same sizing.

```tsx
{
  level1: '',
    ‚ñ∂Ô∏é Biggest heading
  level2: '',
  level3: '',
    ‚ñ∂Ô∏é Default heading level
  level4: '',
  level5: '',
  level6: '',
}
```

The value that you set is the string value that will be set to the `font-size` CSS property.

If you want to learn more about the UiHeading component follow go to this [doc](https://uireact.io/packages-text-docs-heading-docs).

### Texts

The texts uses a structure of 5 different sizes:

```tsx
{
  xsmall: '',
  small: '',
  regular: '',
    ‚ñ∂Ô∏é Default text sizing
  large: '',
  xlarge: ''
}
```

The [TextSizes type](https://github.com/inavac182/uireact/blob/main/packages/foundation/src/types/themes/internal/sizes.ts#L7) its created
from the [TextSize enum](https://github.com/inavac182/uireact/blob/main/packages/foundation/src/types/enums/text-size.ts#L1)

## Texts üìù

Currently we only expose a property for the font family.

```tsx
{
  fonts: '';
}
```

Texts type definition [here](https://github.com/inavac182/uireact/blob/main/packages/foundation/src/types/themes/internal/texts.ts#LL1C1-L1C1)

The value in the `fonts` property is passed as is to the `font-family` css property so you can set up multiple fonts as needed. Just
remember that you have to provide them to the browser if you are using any special font.

## Spacing üìê

As the spacing across the application should keep uniformity we decided to add the spacing to the theme so each client could set up
whatever spacing is more conviniant for their use case. There are 7 levels of spacing:

```tsx
{
  one: '',
  two: '',
  three: '',
  four: '',
  five: '',
  six: '',
  seven: '',
}
```

The [Spacing type](https://github.com/inavac182/uireact/blob/main/packages/foundation/src/types/themes/internal/spacing.ts#L3) its created from the
[Sizing enum](https://github.com/inavac182/uireact/blob/main/packages/foundation/src/types/enums/spacing.ts#LL1C1-L1C1).

This values are used from the [UiSpacing](https://uireact.io/packages-foundation-docs-spacing) component and they are rendered rendered into the margin/padding CSS property depending on what you tell this component to do with that spacing.

## Usage ‚ö°Ô∏è

Once the theme is created we need to set it up into the library context so all components can grab it.

### Set it up into UiView

The component `UiView` sets all the providers and global styles for the components to work properly, e.g. the theme context, dialogs context,
etc... So, you have to wrap your app in a UiView, you can get more information about
this component in the [UiView docs](https://uireact.io/packages-view-docs-view).

TL;DR; Do this:

`myAppWrapper.tsx`:

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { @UiView } from '@uireact/view';
import { DefaultTheme, ThemeColor } from '@uireact/foundation';

export const App = () => (
  <UiView theme={DefaultTheme} selectedTheme={ThemeColor.light}>
    ... {Your App} ...
  </Uiview>
);

```
