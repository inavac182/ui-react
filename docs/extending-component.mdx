# Extending a component styling ‚ú®

<UiLineSeparator />
<br />

We know that there are endless number of use cases and a library to fit them all is not efficient nor possible, so with styled components
you can extend the styling of a component, this is how you would do it.

## Using styled components üíÖüèø

This library is built with styled component, so we suggest you only use it in your main project.

For demo purposes let's render a normal `UiCard` first, so we can see the differences:

<JustACard />

Now, in our client app we would import styled components and apply a custom style to the `UiCard`:

```jsx
  import styled from 'styled-components';

  import { UiCard } from '@uireact/card';

  const CustomUiCard = styled(UiCard)`
    border-radius: 20px 50px 20px 50px;
    box-shadow: rgba(50, 50, 93, 0.25) 0px 50px 100px -20px, rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3) 0px 30px 60px -30px;
  `;

  export const MyComponent = () => {
    return <CustomUiCard>Some content<CustomUiCard>;
  }
```

<ExtendStyleExpample />

<br />
<br />

You can see the component used in this example [Here](https://github.com/inavac182/uireact/tree/main/docs/helpers/extend-styling-example.tsx)

## Using classes

If you are using something like tailwind CSS then you should be able to just pass the class you need applied through the className prop.
