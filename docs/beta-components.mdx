# Beta Components 🐣

<UiLineSeparator />
<br />

A beta component is identified because the published major version is 0.x.x and it has the beta badge:

<UiBadge category="warning">❗️ Beta</UiBadge>

## What this means?

This means that the component is just cooked, maybe with a few features still in progress and it hasn't been tested in production
in any of our ongoing personal projects.

It also means there are possibly breaking changes coming for the component. We try to keep breaking changes at a minimum but sometimes
is just needed to fully have a good component for usage.
