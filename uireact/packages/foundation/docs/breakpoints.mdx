## Definition ✍️

We currently support these breakpoints:

```
enum Breakpoints {
  SMALL,
    ▶︎ Used to render on mobile devices
  MEDIUM,
    ▶︎ Used to render on tablet devices or mobiles with big screens or mobile landscape
  LARGE,
    ▶︎ Used to render on big tablets, tablets on landscape or desktop
  XLARGE,
    ▶︎ Used to render on high resolutions desktop screens
}
```

The [Breakpoints enum](https://github.com/inavac182/uireact/blob/main/packages/foundation/src/types/breakpoints-enum.ts) is exported as part of the package @ui-react/foundation
this enum has the different breakpoints we support.

## Breakpoints sizes

Based on data around internet of the most common resolutions for each device we have decided to set up the supported breakpoints sizes
in the following distribution:

```
const BreakpointsSizes = {
  s: {
    max: 579,
      ▶︎ No min value as anything from 0 up to 579px considered SMALL
  },
  m: {
    min: 580,
    max: 991,
  },
  l: {
    min: 992,
    max: 1440,
  },
  xl: {
    min: 1440,
      ▶︎ No max value as anything above 1440 is considered XLARGE
  },
};
```

**NOTE:** @uireact doesn't distinguish between real mobile device and desktop small breakpoint, they are both categorized as SMALL.
