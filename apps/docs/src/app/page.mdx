## What? 😲

@UiReact is a React library of Themed UI components that are ready to be used to speed up react web development. The themes allows for a lot of customization while trying to keep it simple for theming.

## Why? 🤓

This project started due to personal projects that we worked and everytime we needed to create a set of UI components, theme management, boilerplate code, utils, etc... All while we tried to keep things moving fast! ⚡️ Other UI libraries
were not very good for our use cases, and were not as complete as what we needed, so we just started our own with everything we use.

## Where to start? ✍️

The main package is `@uireact/foundation` were all components uses to retrieve the theme context and afew other tools.
We have a [getting started doc](./getting-started) that will help you to start with this library, it also includes a few examples.
