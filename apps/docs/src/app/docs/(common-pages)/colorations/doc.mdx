import { UiReactViewRotating } from '@uireact/framer-animations';

# <UiIcon icon="Opacity" size='xlarge' motion={{...UiReactViewRotating}} /> Colorations

The theme colorations are `primary`, `secondary` and `tertiary`. The `fonts` color is its own category that should only be used on fonts.
There are also supporting colorations such as `Positive`, `Negative`, `Error` and `Warning`.

## Colors usages

The truth is that you can use them at your best convenience but we highly recommend to follow this pattern:

- <UiText inline category="tertiary">Primary</UiText> - **60%**
- <UiText inline category="tertiary">Secondary</UiText> - **30%**
- <UiText inline category="tertiary">Tertiary</UiText> - **10%**

The supporting colors could be used as needed based on your design system.

## Font color

The primary color to be used on your backgrounds, so your fonts should have a color that totally contrast with this color. 

For instance imagine you want your light theme to use the color **#E7E7E7** then your texts should have a very dark color to contrast correctly like: **#001456**.

```jsx live 
  <div style={{ backgroundColor: "#E7E7E7", padding: "10px", width: "100%", boxSizing: "border-box", borderRadius: "20px" }}>
    <p style={{color: "#001456"}}>Text colors</p>
  </div>
```

## Example on how to choose colorations

The primary and secondary colors are used as the baseline and as the highlight color. 

For instance let's do some mock up thinking that your brand color is: <ColorationHolder color='#1CCB2F' coloration='dark' /> and you want to keep your app with a green-ish coloration.

**Example**

The **tertiary** color would go to : <ColorationHolder color='#1CCB2F' coloration='dark' /> by default as its your brand color.

For **primary** color we will use a soft color like this for light theme: <ColorationHolder color='#E7E7E7' coloration='dark' /> and this for dark theme: <ColorationHolder color='#051C08' coloration='light' />

The **font** color for the **light** theme could be: <ColorationHolder color='#0D4313' coloration='light' /> to be readable on light colorations.

For the **dark** theme, the **font** color could be: <ColorationHolder color='#F2F7EB' coloration='dark' /> to be readble on dark colorations.

Now, for the **secondary** color we can choose a green color that looks great behind the inverse font color like: <ColorationHolder color='#2D5809' coloration='light' /> for light and this: <ColorationHolder color='#C8DEB6' coloration='dark' /> for dark.

**Light coloration**

```jsx live scope={{UiFlexGrid, UiFlexGridItem, CustomCard, CustomText, TertiaryButton}}
  <CustomCard backgroundColor="#E7E7E7">
    <UiFlexGrid alignItems="center" justifyContent="stretch" gap='two'>
      <UiFlexGridItem grow={2}>
        <CustomText color="#0D4313">Font text for light theme on primary coloration</CustomText>
      </UiFlexGridItem>
      <CustomCard backgroundColor="#2D5809">
        <CustomText color="#F2F7EB">Inverse font on secondary</CustomText>
      </CustomCard>
    </UiFlexGrid>
    <hr style={{ margin: "10px 0" }} />
    <TertiaryButton>
      <CustomText color="#0D4313">Tertiary button</CustomText>
    </TertiaryButton>
  </CustomCard>
```

**Dark coloration**

```jsx live scope={{UiFlexGrid, UiFlexGridItem, CustomCard, CustomText, TertiaryButton}}
  <CustomCard backgroundColor="#0B1503">
    <UiFlexGrid alignItems="center" justifyContent="stretch" gap='two'>
      <UiFlexGridItem grow={2}>
        <CustomText color="#F2F7EB">Font text for dark theme on primary coloration</CustomText>
      </UiFlexGridItem>
      <CustomCard backgroundColor="#C8DEB6">
        <CustomText color="#0D4313">Inverse font on secondary</CustomText>
      </CustomCard>
    </UiFlexGrid>
    <hr style={{ margin: "10px 0" }} />
    <TertiaryButton>
      <CustomText color="#F2F7EB">Tertiary button</CustomText>
    </TertiaryButton>
  </CustomCard>
```

This is a very simple exercise that we put together so you can get a head start on colorations, but the best thing would be for you to get started
and then just play around with your colorations.
